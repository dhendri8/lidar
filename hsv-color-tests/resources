Got the python module to read from camera, also got sliders working so that I could fine tune HSV filters.
Maybe I can set it up to have an export button where it will just poop the values into a config file that I can then use to read into python and calibrate the laser

Found out that laser shows up as white on a white background if you're too close
If you shine against a black background then it's easier to filter. 
If you put a lens to filter the bright light out (lens over camera) then it's also easier to filter.



TODO: 

    - Figure out how to do the math involved with the range detection thingy
    - Figure out how I can get angle values from my phones gyro into the computer (for doing math thingys)
