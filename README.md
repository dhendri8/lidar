TODO: 
    - -Figure out how to do the math involved with the range detection thingy-
        - figure out how to do the angle detection from this site https://sites.google.com/site/todddanko/home/webcam_laser_ranger 
    - Figure out how I can get angle values from my phones gyro into the computer (for doing math thingys)
    - Design and build a more robust / more precise mount for the laser / camera. 
        - Mount the whole thing on a tripod
        - Take pics at 1 foot increments from 1 to 10 feet for calibration.
